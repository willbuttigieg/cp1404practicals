# CP1404 Practicals

Practical work for IT@JCU CP1404

## About me

I am studying a Bachelor of Science at JCU majoring in data science. This repository contains the practical work from
CP1404 Programming II.

## Lessons I have learnt about "clean code":

- You should be able to read code anytime in the future and get an understanding of what it does.
- SRP is one of the keys to writing great functions.
- Beautiful is better than ugly, simple is better than complex, readability counts.
