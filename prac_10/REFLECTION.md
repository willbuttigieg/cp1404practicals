# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

It was not too good, both over and under.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

It stayed pretty much the same the whole time, pretty poor.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

That I do not have a grasp on how long certain things take me and I need to spend some more time on some topics.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

There are many ways to do the same thing sometimes, reviewing other people's code shows this. It also ensured I knew 
what I was doing because I needed to know what I was talking about before I could judge other people's work.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

It is important to write clear code so that anyone reading it can understand it.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Prac 9 Code Review](https://github.com/braithseidenkranz/cp1404practicals/pull/5)

### Explanation

I gave code examples of the improvements, not just saying their work is bad.

### Good Code Review 2

[Prac 8 Code Review](https://github.com/Jamie7479/cp1404practicals/pull/4)

### Explanation

Instead of just outright saying the person is wrong, I asked why they had done things the way they did. This is because 
I was not sure that they were wrong, and it could cause confusion if I just told them they were wrong.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

Include a link to the PR and code review instructions from prac 5 in all pracs for convenience.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

Completed all the practical tasks.
