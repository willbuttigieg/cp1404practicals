# CP1404 Practical Reflection

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

I have been getting better at finishing my work sooner so that I have more time for checking over my work.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I still need to start watching the lecture videos before it's too late. I have been running out of time on Monday night to finish the videos because I start too late.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

Completing the pracs on the practical day to ensure I do not forget to come back to it is working well for me.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

When I finish the practical work for one week, I should move onto the content for the following week to ensure I watch all the lecture videos before the next seminar

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

Stop doing joint classes with Cairns students unless the AV system is going to work first time everytime.
